\section*{Abstract}

We provide an overview of a implementation of Gaussian Mixture Models in the C++ language,
as well as parallelised versions of the Expectation Maximisation (EM) and {\it k}-means training algorithms.
Parallelisation is achieved through refactoring the original EM and {\it k}-means algorithms into a MapReduce-like framework
and employing OpenMP compiler directives.
The implementation is available in recent releases of the Armadillo C++ linear algebra library.
