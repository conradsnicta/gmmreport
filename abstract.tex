\section*{Abstract}

We provide an overview of a implementation of Gaussian Mixture Models in the C++ language,
as well as parallelised versions of the Expectation Maximisation (EM) and {\it k}-means training algorithms.
Parallelisation is achieved through refactoring the original EM and {\it k}-means algorithms into a MapReduce-like framework
and employing OpenMP compiler directives.
We demonstrate the that the parallelised versions achieve speedups of an order of magnitude on recent processors.
The implementation is available in recent releases of the Armadillo C++ linear algebra library.
