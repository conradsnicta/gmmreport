\section*{Abstract}

We provide an overview of an implementation of Gaussian Mixture Models in the C++ language,
as well as multi-threaded (parallelised) versions of the Expectation Maximisation (EM) and {\it k}-means training algorithms.
Parallelisation is achieved through reformulation of the EM and {\it k}-means algorithms into a MapReduce-like framework
and employing OpenMP compiler directives.
We demonstrate the that the parallelisation achieves a speedup of an order of magnitude on a recent 16 core machine.
The implementation is available in recent releases of the open source Armadillo C++ linear algebra library.
