\section*{Abstract}

Modelling of multivariate densities is a core component in many signal processing, pattern recognition and machine learning applications.
We provide an overview of a fast implementation of Gaussian mixture models in the C++ language,
which employs multi-threaded (parallelised) versions of the Expectation Maximisation (EM) and {\it k}-means training algorithms.
Parallelisation is achieved through reformulation of the EM and {\it k}-means algorithms into a MapReduce-like framework
and employing OpenMP compiler directives.
We demonstrate that the parallelised implementation achieves a speedup of an order of magnitude on a recent 16 core machine.
The implementation is included as a user-friendly class in recent releases of the open source Armadillo C++ linear algebra library,
which is provided under the permissive Apache 2.0 license, allowing unencumbered use in commercial products.
