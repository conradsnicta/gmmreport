\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we have demonstrated a parallelized implementation of Gaussian
Mixture Models, which is released as part of the publicly available Armadillo
C++ linear algebra library.  Through effective parallelization and restriction
of the problem to diagonal-covariance settings, we show that the Armadillo
implementation is able to significantly outperform other GMM implementations
without significant fitting losses.
