\section{Conclusion}

% In this paper we have demonstrated a parallelised implementation of Gaussian
% Mixture Models, which is released as part of the publicly available Armadillo
% C++ linear algebra library.  Through effective parallelization and restriction
% of the problem to diagonal-covariance settings, we show that the Armadillo
% implementation is able to significantly outperform other GMM implementations
% without significant fitting losses.

In this paper we have demonstrated a multi-threaded and robust implementation
of Gaussian Mixture Models in the C++ language.
Multi-threading is achieved through reformulation of the Expectation-Maximisation and {\it k}-means algorithms into a MapReduce-like framework.
The implementation also uses several techniques to improve numerical stability and improve modelling accuracy.
We demonstrated that the implementation achieves a speedup of an order of magnitude on a recent 16 core machine,
and that it can achieve higher modelling accuracy than a previously well-established publically accessible implementation.
The multi-threaded implementation is \mbox{released} as open source software
and included in recent releases of the cross-platform Armadillo C++ linear algebra library.
The library is provided under the permissive Apache~2.0 license, allowing unencumbered use in commercial products.
